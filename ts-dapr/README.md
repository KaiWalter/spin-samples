## Load Testing message distribution with Spin and Dapr

This folder / instance of tests assumes that an environment has been created in Azure with branch `spin` of repository <https://github.com/KaiWalter/message-distribution> and that `.env` files match in both (message-disitribution and spin-samples) repository folders on your system.

With that the same test message generation can be re-used to establish basic comparability between tech stacks.
